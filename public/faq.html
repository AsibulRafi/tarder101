                        Yes. As you’re completing the Account Application, simply complete the margin and/or options section. We’ll review the information, and if appropriate, extend margin and/or options privileges to your account. 
                        Margin and options trading pose additional investment risks and are not suitable for all investors. In addition, certain account types may not be eligible for margin, options, or advanced options trading privileges. Please read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options, Margin Disclosure Document, Margin Account Handbook, and Day Trading Margin Requirements.

                  Funds typically post to your account 1-2 days after we receive your check or electronic deposit. Once the fund`s post, you can trade most securities. Electronic deposits can take another 3-4 business days to clear; checks can take 5-6 business days. 
                Until your deposit clears, we restrict withdrawals and trading off some securities based on market risk. This includes—but isn’t limited to—options and most stocks priced under $5 per share. 
                 All electronic deposits are subject to review and may be restricted for 60 days. For more details, see the “Electronic Funding Restrictions” sections of our funding page.
